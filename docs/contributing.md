# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/znck/attach).


## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - Don't worry about it, we have setup [StyleCI](https://styleci.io) to help you out.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and `docs` are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.

- **Incomplete PRs** - We encourage to send incomplete pull requests to start discussions. Use `[WIP]` in pull request title. e.g. `[WIP] Update Documentation`

- **Emoticons** - A suggestion; use emojis to explicitly show the type of commit. Consider [Carlos Cuesta's](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: guide or be creative.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```


**Happy coding**! :computer:
